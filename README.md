# QR_code_Generator

a simple project that generates a QR code image based on the text input by the user. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. You have three elements defined using `getElementById`:

   - `imgBox`: This is an element with the ID "imgBox". It's likely a container or a div that will hold the QR code image.
   - `qrImage`: This is an element with the ID "qrImage". It's likely an `<img>` element where the QR code image will be displayed.
   - `qrText`: This is an element with the ID "qrText". It's likely an `<input>` element where the user can input text to generate the QR code.

2. The `generateQR` function is defined. This function is called when you want to generate a QR code based on the text input by the user.

3. Inside the `generateQR` function:

   - It checks if the length of the text entered in the `qrText` input field is greater than 0 (i.e., if there is some text entered by the user).
   - If there is text, it constructs a URL for generating a QR code using the "https://api.qrserver.com" API. It uses the `qrText.value` as the data for the QR code and sets the `src` attribute of the `qrImage` element to this URL.
   - It also adds the CSS class "show-img" to the `imgBox` element. This class is likely used to control the visibility or appearance of the QR code image.
   - If there is no text entered by the user, it adds the CSS class "error" to the `qrText` input field to indicate an error state, and then removes this class after a 1-second delay using `setTimeout`. This error handling is likely used to prompt the user to enter text before generating the QR code.
